Anyhow, I started to land it at the end of last season but I don't look good or feel comfortable and I don't press the nose much but it feels really cool. I just wanna get better at it, more speed, more style etc."

Got a little over confident, didn't get all the way around, and slammed harder than I have since trying to learn going from toe to heel turns! They definitely are a fun trick for those days cruising with friends on slow runs."

I get bored so I need something to try while going slow, butters are perfect. Ya the backside nose roll seems a little more dangerous, caught heel edge waiting to happen. haha. It is on my list but I want to get good at frontside first."

Your worst & slowest 180 is what all of mine look like. :frown: You look pretty effortless on most of them. That is what I want by the end of the season: higher speed, more control of spin/edge, and effortless. It's a nice low consequence trick for an old fat guy to work on while riding with his kids. Thanks for the vid."
