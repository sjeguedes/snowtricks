            description: "A slide performed where the riders leading foot passes over the rail on approach, with their snowboard traveling perpendicular along the rail or other obstacle.

This is often confusing to new riders learning the trick because with a frontside boardslide you are moving backward and with a backside boardslide you are moving forward."
